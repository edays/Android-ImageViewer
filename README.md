Thank you for using Fotag, a image viewing tool combines loading, rating and filtering images

Important Features:
1. AI Mode.
Fotag will learn to auto sort pictures when user uses filter. 
Higher rating images will begin showing in front of the lower rating images.
This algorithm is in version 1.

2. Custome theme UI
Future plan: add UI selectors. User will be able to design their own UI.

Instructions:

1. Open the navigation bar, press "Load" to load image from pre-set url. All urls pre-saved
in xml for easy changes. Images are NOT pre-saved on the stack. Therefore, if url source 
on the remote server changes while user is using Fotag, the image will change upon next "Load".

2. Open the navigation bar, press "Clear" to clear all images and ratings.
Note: The ratings are also cleared after clearing images.

3. Filter: Show All - Rating 0-5
           Favorite - Rating 5

4. Press the image will open a image in fullscreen.
